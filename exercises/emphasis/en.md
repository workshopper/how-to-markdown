It's easy to mark text as _italic_, **bold**, _**combined**_ and ~~strikethrough~~. There are a few ways to make emphasis in Markdown and each of those is readable.

To get emphasis just wrap some text in single, double or triple asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`). Here are some examples:

    Italics with *asterisks* and _underscores_.

**|>** Italics with *asterisks* and _underscores_.

    Bold with **asterisks** or __underscores__

**|>** Bold with **asterisks** or __underscores__

    Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

**|>** Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Sometimes you need to draw line through the text. To get strikethrough wrap the text in two tildes (`~`) like so:

    ~~Scratch this line.~~

**|>** ~~Scratch this line.~~

## THE CHALLENGE

Create a new file and add a first-level heading at the top of your file. This heading should contain `Emphasis` as text.

Below the heading, add this text:

    It's very easy to use italic, bold and combined emphasis in Markdown!

Please, mark _italic_, **bold** and _**combined**_ using relevant styles.
