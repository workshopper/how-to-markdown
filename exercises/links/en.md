We often need to make a reference for something. There are two ways to create links: _inline-style_ and _reference-style_.

By the way, the easiest way to create a link is to just paste the link into a Markdown file. URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links:

    http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com>

**|>** http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com>

### Inline style

Links in Markdown have this format:

    [text](href "alt")

Above, `text` is text that will be a link, `href` is your reference to the resource (similar to `href` attribute in HTML), `alt` is an alternative text for link (similar to `alt` attribute in HTML). Text in a link may have any formatting, which means you are able to use emphasis in your links, if needed.

Here are more real world examples:

    [Google](https://www.google.com)
    [Google Homepage](https://www.google.com "Google Homepage")

## Reference style

Sometimes you have to use the same link in different places, so it would be convenient to use one reference for all of these links. So you may do this like so:

    [NodeSchool Site][ref]
    [GitHub][1]
    [Remark parser]

    Some text to show that the reference links can follow later:

    [ref]: http://www.nodeschool.io
    [1]: https://github.com/
    [Remark parser]: http://remark.js.org/

As you may notice above, references are case-insensitive and you are free to use numbers for creating references or use link text itself as its reference.

## THE CHALLENGE

At the top of the file, add a first-level heading with `Links` text.

Here you have some text:

    how-to-markdown is a workshopper that teach you how to write Markdown.

Please, copy this text to the new file and mark **'how-to-markdown'** phrase as reference-style link with reference to itself. Below in your file, add a relevant reference which will reference to the `//git.io/how-to-markdown`.

When you are done, please, verify your solution.
